**Object-Oriented Programming in Java**

**1. Object-Oriented Programming Language:**
   - Java is a robust, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for developing various types of applications. It follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), which revolves around the concept of objects.

**2. Class:**
   - A class in Java serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will exhibit.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     public class Car {
         // Fields
         String brand;
         String model;
         int year;
         
         // Constructor
         public Car(String brand, String model, int year) {
             this.brand = brand;
             this.model = model;
             this.year = year;
         }
         
         // Method
         public void start() {
             System.out.println("The car is starting.");
         }
     }
     ```

**3. Object:**
   - An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and has its own state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020);
     ```

**4. Features of Object-Oriented Programming:**
   - **Encapsulation:** 
     - Encapsulation is the bundling of data (fields) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (i.e., class). It helps in data hiding and prevents direct access to the data from outside the class.
   - **Abstraction:** 
     - Abstraction focuses on hiding the implementation details of methods and providing only the necessary features to the outside world. It allows for managing complexity by defining a simplified interface.
   - **Inheritance:** 
     - Inheritance is a mechanism in which a class (subclass or child class) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or parent class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
   - **Polymorphism:** 
     - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be defined in multiple forms, such as method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).

**5. Access Modifiers:**
   - Access modifiers in Java control the visibility of classes, methods, and fields. They determine how these elements can be accessed from other parts of the program.
   - **private:** 
     - Private members are accessible only within the same class. They are not visible to other classes, even subclasses.
   - **public:** 
     - Public members are accessible from any other class. They can be freely accessed and invoked.
   - **protected:** 
     - Protected members are accessible within the same package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
   - **default (package-private):** 
     - Default members are accessible only within the same package. They are not visible to classes outside the package.
