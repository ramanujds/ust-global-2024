# What is Java?

**Programming language**
- Java is a high-level, versatile, and widely-used programming language.

**Object Oriented**
- It follows the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, emphasizing concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

**Platform Independent**
- Java programs can run on any device or operating system, thanks to its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy. This is achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

# JDK (Java Development Kit)
- A software development kit that includes necessary tools for developing, compiling, and running Java applications.

**Compiler**
- Translates Java source code (.java files) into bytecode (.class files) that can be executed by the JVM.

**JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**
- Provides the runtime environment needed for executing Java applications. It includes the JVM and core libraries.

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
- Executes Java bytecode and ensures platform independence by providing a consistent environment.

**java --version**
- Command to check the installed Java version.

# Program Compilation and Execution

**Source code - Program.java**
- Java program written in a text file with a ".java" extension.

**javac Program.java**
- Command to compile Java source code, producing bytecode.

**java Program**
- Command to execute the compiled Java program.

**IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**
- Software tools like Intellij Idea, Eclipse, and VS Code that provide a comprehensive environment for Java development.

# Keywords, Identifiers, Variables, Functions, Literals

- **Keywords:** Reserved words with predefined meanings (e.g., int, float, double, long).
- **Identifiers:** User-defined names for classes, variables, methods, etc.
- **Variables:** Storage locations with a specific data type (e.g., int count, float average, String firstName).
- **Functions:** Blocks of code with a name, parameters, and return type.
- **Literals:** Literal representations of values (e.g., 1, 2.5, "Hello").

# Reading and Printing Values in Java

**Control Structures**
- **Branching:** if-else, switch.
- **Looping:** while, do-while, for.

# Naming Standard

- **Class/Interface Names:** Start with uppercase (e.g., String, StringBuffer).
- **Variables/Method Names:** Start with lowercase and follow camel casing (e.g., int count, float average, String firstName).
- **Package Name:** Lowercase, no camel casing.
- **Constants:** Uppercase (e.g., final double PI = 3.14).

# Time Complexity

- **O(1):** Constant time.
- **O(n):** Linear time.
- **O(logn):** Logarithmic time.
- **O(n^2):** Quadratic time.
- **O(n log n):** Linearithmic time.

# Space Complexity

Describes the amount of memory space an algorithm or program uses in relation to the input size

# Notations

- **Big O (O):** Describes the worst-case scenario.
- **Omega (Ω):** Describes the best-case scenario.
- **Theta (Θ):** Describes the average-case scenario.

# Finding the 2nd Largest Element from an Array

```java
arr = [2, 8, 9, 3, 6, 7, 10]
// Logic to find the 2nd largest element goes here
```
