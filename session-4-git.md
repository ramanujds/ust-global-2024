**Version Control Systems (VCS):**

**Introduction and Usage of Version Control:**
Version Control Systems are tools that manage changes to source code, documents, or any set of files over time. They enable collaboration among multiple contributors by keeping track of modifications, allowing users to revert to previous versions, and merging changes made by different individuals. VCS is crucial in software development to maintain code integrity, track changes, and facilitate teamwork.

**Examples of Version Control Systems:**
1. **Git:** Distributed VCS, widely used for its speed and flexibility.
2. **Subversion (SVN):** Centralized VCS, tracks changes with a central repository.
3. **Mercurial:** Another distributed VCS, known for its simplicity and ease of use.

**Types of Version Control Systems:**
1. **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS):** Uses a central server to store all versions of a file.
   - *Example:* SVN (Subversion)

2. **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):** Each user has a complete copy of the repository, promoting flexibility and offline work.
   - *Example:* Git, Mercurial

**Setting Up Git:**
1. **Installation:**
   - Download and install Git from the official website: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

4. **Commit:**
   - A snapshot of changes made to the repository.

5. **Branch:**
   - A parallel version of the code that can be developed independently.

6. **Merge:**
   - Integrating changes from one branch into another.

7. **Pull Request (PR):**
   - A proposed change to a repository submitted by a user.

8. **Clone:**
   - Copying a repository from a remote source to your local machine.

9. **Push:**
   - Uploading local repository changes to a remote repository.

10. **Pull:**
    - Downloading changes from a remote repository to a local machine.

   - **Description:** Records staged changes in the repository.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add initial version of myfile.txt"
     ```

5. **Check Repository Status:**
   - **Command:** `git status`
   - **Description:** Displays the current status of the working directory.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

6. **View Commit History:**
   - **Command:** `git log`
   - **Description:** Shows a log of all commits in the repository.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

7. **Create a Branch:**
   - **Command:** `git branch <branch_name>`
   - **Description:** Creates a new branch.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git branch feature-branch
     ```

8. **Switch to a Branch:**
   - **Command:** `git checkout <branch_name>`
   - **Description:** Switches to the specified branch.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git checkout feature-branch
     ```

9. **Merge Branches:**
   - **Command:** `git merge <branch_name>`
   - **Description:** Merges changes from one branch into another.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge feature-branch
     ```

10. **Push Changes to Remote Repository:**
    - **Command:** `git push <remote_name> <branch_name>`

### Working with Git


#### a. Code Reviews in Git
Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality and collaboration in a development team. Here's how to perform and raise a request for code reviews:

- **Performing Code Reviews:**
  - Review the changes in the pull request.
  - Examine the code for readability, adherence to coding standards, and potential bugs.
  - Provide constructive feedback on the code.

- **Raising a Request for Code Reviews:**
  - Create a new branch for your changes.
  - Make necessary changes and commit them.
  - Push the branch to the repository.
  - Open a pull request, describing the changes and requesting a review.

#### b. Merging in Git
Merging is the process of combining changes from different branches into a single branch. Here's how to perform a merge in Git:

- **Basic Merging:**
  - Switch to the branch where you want to merge changes.
  - Use the `git merge` command followed by the branch name to merge changes.

- **Fast-forward Merging:**
  - When the branch being merged is a direct ancestor, Git performs a fast-forward merge.

#### c. Multiple Commits (Squash Commits) in Git
Squashing commits allows combining multiple commits into a single commit for cleaner version history:

- **Squashing Commits:**
  - Use `git rebase -i HEAD~n`, where n is the number of commits you want to squash.
  - In the interactive rebase, replace "pick" with "squash" or "s" for the commits you want to squash.

#### d. Merge Conflicts in Git
Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches. Common scenarios leading to conflicts include:

- **Simultaneous Edits:**
  - When two branches modify the same line in conflicting ways.

- **Deleted File or Renamed Files:**
  - Conflicts can occur when one branch deletes a file or renames it while the other modifies it.

#### e. Handling Merge Conflicts
To resolve merge conflicts, follow these steps:

- **Locate Conflicts:**
  - Git marks conflicted files. Open these files to locate and resolve conflicts manually.

- **Resolve Conflicts:**
  - Edit the conflicted files, keeping the desired changes.

- **Mark as Resolved:**
  - Use `git add` to mark the files as resolved.

- **Complete Merge:**
  - Continue with `git merge --continue` or `git rebase --continue` to complete the merge.
