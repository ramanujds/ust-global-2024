Problem Statement: The Mysterious Number Guesser

You are tasked with creating a Java program that acts as a "Mysterious Number Guesser." The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and challenge the user to guess the correct number.

Here are the specifications for the program:

1. The program should display a welcome message and instructions for the user.

2. It should generate a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and store it as the "mysterious number."

3. The user should be prompted to enter their guess.

4. If the user's guess is correct, the program should congratulate the user and terminate.

5. If the user's guess is incorrect, the program should provide a hint:
    - If the guess is within 10 units of the mysterious number (either higher or lower), the program should say, "You're getting close!"
    - If the guess is more than 10 units away from the mysterious number, the program should say, "You're far away!"


Example Output:
```
Welcome to the Mysterious Number Guesser!
I have selected a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?

Enter your guess: 50
You're getting close!

Enter your guess: 75
You're far away!

Enter your guess: 65
You're getting close!

Enter your guess: abc
Error: Please enter a valid integer.

Enter your guess: 70
Congratulations! You guessed the mysterious number!
```
